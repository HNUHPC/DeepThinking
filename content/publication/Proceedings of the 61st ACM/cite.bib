abstract = {Compared with conventional SRAM, Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory(STT-RAM) is expected to play a crucial role in future memory technologies with the increasing demands for higher storage density and lower power consumption for modern embedded systems. Moreover, Multi-Level Cell (MLC) STT-RAM outperforms Single-Level Cell (SLC) STT-RAM since it has higher bit density. However, MLC STT-RAM suffers from write performance due to the two-step state transitions (TTs) in memory cells' soft domain. State-of-the-art approaches mitigate this issue by reducing TTs with efficient data coding. Unfortunately, none of the existing works can fully eliminate the TTs. In this work, zeroTT, an optimal (3, 4)-based expansion coding method that eliminates TTs for MLC STT-RAM. The design of ZeroTT considers space overhead and coding complexity, and our experimental results demonstrate that zeroTT can completely avoid TTs, leading to a more efficient MLC STT-RAM memory in terms of access latency, energy consumption, and device lifetime.},
